- The driver with the identifier A97 has the highest risk factor, significantly higher than the others.
- Oshkosh has the highest average risk factor, with significant contributions from lane departure and overspeed events. Western Star has the lowest average risk factor among the listed models, with a more balanced distribution of event types.
- Each truck model's fuel efficiency went up and down over the years. Crane's fuel efficiency dropped significantly after 2011, whereas Western Star improved a lot in fuel efficiency between 2010 and 2011. By 2013, most truck models had similar fuel efficiency.
- The city of Hollister has a very high risk factor of 8.5, suggesting that additional training is required to bring down the risk factors of truck drivers in the area.
